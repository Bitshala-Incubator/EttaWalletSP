Etta Wallet will be a resource for experimenting with non-custodial lightning with a strong bias towards usability, accessibility and good UX.

The project is strongly inspired by [Bitcoin Design Community's daily spending wallet](https://bitcoin.design/guide/daily-spending-wallet/) and will continue to evolve with their sound suggestions.

## Reproducible Build (**Don't trust, verify**)

Start by [forking the repo](https://github.com/EttaWallet/EttaWallet/fork) from GitHub, clone it locally and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/EttaWallet
cd EttaWallet
yarn install
```

### Developing

Once you've cloned the repo, installed dependencies, run the following command.

```bash
yarn start
```

#### Android

1. Using a physical android phone? Enable Developer mode and USB Debugging, and confirm it is connected by running `adb devices`. If you want to use an Android simulator, this step isn't necessary
2. Open a new tab in your terminal and run `yarn android`

### iOS

1. Open a new tab in your terminal
2. `cd ios && pod install`. For M1, you might have to do `arch -x86_64 pod install`
3. `cd .. && yarn ios`.

## Contributing

EttaWallet is an open-source project so anybody can use and contribute to it. You also don't necessarily need to know how to code. Some meaningful contributions include:

- Sharing ideas and suggestions
- Improving documentation
- Sharing well-written bug reports
- Improving the translation scope.
- Requesting new features.

You can start in the [discussion forum here](https://github.com/orgs/EttaWallet/discussions).

If you would like to contribute code, here a few guidelines:

- It would be helpful to create an issue first before submitting a PR just to make sure nobody isn't working on the same yet or it just wouldn't be a good fit.
- Even if your changes are obvious, your PR should define what you are changing. Nothing is too obvious. 
- PRs should be opened against the `next` branch.

### Branches

`current` - The latest release

`next` - The branch to submit pull requests against. It mirrors what's coming in the next release
