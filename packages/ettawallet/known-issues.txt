// Cipher-base error
currently cipher-base, a dependency of create-hash requires stream. 
Was able to install the necessary cryptographic utilities but app fails at runtime.
To fix the issue, I directly edited ../node_module/cipher-base/index.js, changing 'stream' to 'readable-stream'.

I have patch-packages installed, but for some reason, I can't get it to work in the lerna workspace, ergo @TODO
