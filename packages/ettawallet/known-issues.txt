General Issues

// Cipher-base error: currently cipher-base, a dependency of create-hash requires stream. 
    Fix: Updated the node_module file, changing the requirement from "stream" to "readable-stream" and generated a patch


IOS-only Issues

// PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code within bdk-rn package causing Build failure in xcode
    Fix: In Xcode: - Pods -> Targets -> bdk-rn -> Build Phases -> Copy XCFrameworks -> check "for install builds only"

// Undefined symbols error from RNSecureRandom. 
    - Fix: Inside react-native-securerandom folder in node_modules, find RNSecureRandom.podspec, change s.dependency from "React" to "React-Core". Then generated a patch and reinstalled Pods
